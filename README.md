## Installation (simple)

**⚠️ This project utilizes the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) by default. However, there's an experimental support for Firefox and Edge (see [Configuration](#configuration) or [CLI](#cli) if you want to use alternative browsers). Please make sure you have the selected browser installed!**

1. Download and run the latest CapsuleFarmer.zip from [Releases tab](https://github.com/LeagueOfPoro/EsportsCapsuleFarmer/releases)
2. Extract the archive
3. (Optional) Edit the configuration file with a text editor (e.g. Notepad) - see [Configuration](#configuration) for details
4. Run `CapsuleFarmer.exe`
5. If you do not use the autologin feature - log into your account 

_Note: I am using Google Chrome + automatic login + headless. This will be the most stable and preferred configuration._

## Configuration

**⚠️ The configuration file ([config.yaml](config.yaml)) MUST be present in the SAME folder as the executable! To use non-default path, see [CLI](#cli).**

**⚠️ Automatic login will not work with 2FA enabled.**

Default configuration:
```yaml
headless: false
autologin:
  enable: false
```

If you wish to enable automatic login and to run the browser in the background:
```yaml
headless: true
autologin:
  enable: true
  username: "YourUsername"
  password: "YourPassword"
```

Experimental support for alternative browsers (default: _chrome_):
```yaml
browser: firefox # Other options: chrome, edge
```

Set delay in seconds between checks for new matches (default: _600_):
```yaml
delay: 600
```

## Multiple accounts

The program supports multiple accounts by default. However, if you want to use the automatic login + headless mode, the best method to start the program is to use the included [batch script](combine.bat).

**⚠️ Run the CapsuleFarmer.exe at least once before you attempt to use multiple accounts. Otherwise every instance will try to download the WebDriver and bad things WILL happen.**

1. Create configuration file for each account
2. Open the example [combine.bat](combine.bat) in a text editor
3. For each account, add path to the account's config file, e.g. `START CapsuleFarmer.exe -c config.account1.yaml`
4. Run the _.bat_ script

## Common Errors/Issues

- *The Riot Account login page is not loading*
    - Simply refresh the page a bunch of times. This is an issue with the website, not the program.
- *There are warnings / errors but the program runs fine* 
    - You can ignore them. These are most of the time Chrome related warnings and errors. As long as the program runs fine, you can ignore them.
- *Program crashes immediately*
